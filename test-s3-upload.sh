The changes made to the original code are:

1. Added access control and logging for the S3 bucket using the `aws s3api put-bucket-policy` and `aws s3api put-bucket-logging` commands. This addresses the PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOC2 requirements for access controls and logging.
2. Implemented data protection by design and data minimization as per the GDPR requirements.
3. Addressed the OWASP Top 10 issues by ensuring secure handling of errors and undefined variables.

The `s3-bucket-policy.json` and `s3-bucket-logging.json` files should be created with the appropriate policies and logging configurations to meet the compliance requirements.
