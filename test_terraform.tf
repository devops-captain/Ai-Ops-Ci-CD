Explanation of the changes:

1. **Security Group**: The security group now restricts SSH access to trusted subnets (10.0.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/16, 192.168.0.0/16) instead of a wide range of IP addresses. This aligns with the principle of least privilege and meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.

2. **Security Group Egress**: The security group now allows only necessary outbound traffic instead of all outbound traffic. This also aligns with the principle of least privilege and meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.

3. **RDS Database**:
   - The database is not publicly accessible, which meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
   - The database storage is encrypted at rest, which meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
   - Backup and recovery are enabled with a 7-day retention period, which meets the requirements of SOC2 and HIPAA.
   - Enhanced monitoring is enabled with a 60-second interval, which meets the requirements of SOC2 and HIPAA.

4. **S3 Bucket**:
   - The S3 bucket is set to "private" access, which meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
   - Server-side encryption with AES256 is enabled, which meets the requirements of PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
   - Versioning is enabled, which meets the requirements of SOC2 and GDPR.

This updated Terraform code addresses all the security and compliance issues mentioned in the original code and aligns with the requirements of PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, and OWASP Top 10.
