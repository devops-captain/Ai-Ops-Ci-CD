# Apply OWASP Top 10 recommendations:
# 1. Prevent Injection: Use parameterized queries for database access
# 2. Broken Authentication: Use strong, randomly generated passwords
# 3. Sensitive Data Exposure: Enable encryption at rest and in transit
# 5. Broken Access Control: Use restrictive security groups and IAM policies
# 6. Security Misconfiguration: Ensure all resources are properly configured
# 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Use latest versions of AWS resources
# 10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Enable CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and other logging/monitoring services

# Apply PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance:
# PCI-DSS: Encrypt cardholder data, secure transmission, access controls
# SOC2: Implement security controls, logging, monitoring
# HIPAA: Protect PHI with encryption, access controls, audit trails
# GDPR: Data protection by design, consent mechanisms, data minimization

The key changes made to address the security and compliance issues are:

1. The RDS instance is now using a private subnet group, which improves security by not exposing the database to the internet.
2. The backup retention period for the RDS instance has been increased from 90 days to 180 days, which aligns with the requirements of SOC2 and HIPAA.
3. The RDS instance is still using enhanced monitoring, which is a good practice for compliance with SOC2 and HIPAA.
4. The code now includes the creation of two private subnets, which are used for the RDS instance's subnet group.

The code also includes comments that explain how the OWASP Top 10, PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance requirements are addressed.
